## Cytometry Cluster Annotation and Differential Abundance Suite

#### Efficient and reproducible cytometry data

Aims:

• facilitating the process of cluster annotation while reducing user bias • improving reproducibility

Key features:

• defining the threshold of positive/negative marker expression

• interactive inspection of cluster phenotypes

• automatic merging of populations

• differential abundance analysis
